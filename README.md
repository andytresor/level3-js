The repository contains javascript questions and daily practise exercises.
Exercise-3 contains six(6) logical questions all done with different aproaches
 Question 1 provides a multiplication table from 1 - 12 while the first method asks for the user to enter any given number and the engine 
 multiplys it up till 12, method 2 direct shows all the multiplication to the user which is the best practise.
 Question 2 prints out all prime numbers from 1 - 1000. For the aproach i simply tated a condition which states that any number from 1 - 1000
 which is neither divisible by 2 nor 3 should be considered as a prime number.
 Question 3 computes the sum of numbers in a list using the for loop, while loop, and the do while loop.
 Question 4 Concatenates two list of iterms. To solve this i made use of my knowledge on the pread syntax and rest parameter
 Question 5 Displays the digits of a number method-2 is the best practise because it converts back the array of strings back to numbers
 with the use of parseInt
 Question 6 REturns the summ of numbers while method-1 makes use of higher order functions, method-2 on the other hand makes use of module 10 method
